## Process

1. Data Preparation

- Clean employee dataset (demographics, compensation, satisfaction, performance).

- Remove irrelevant/constant fields (e.g., EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours).

2. Analysis Steps

Calculate attrition rate = (Attrition "Yes") รท Total employees ร 100 (by department).

- Compare compensation across gender/roles.

- Analyze salary distributions (attrition vs. retention).

- Evaluate tenure (years at company, years since last promotion).

- Assess work-life balance across roles.

3. Visualization Tools

- Power BI/Tableau/Excel dashboards with bar charts, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps.

## Project Insights

- Attrition Patterns: Certain departments (likely Sales or Support) show higher attrition rates.

- Compensation & Fairness: Lower monthly income is strongly linked with attrition. Some disparities may exist between genders in technical roles.

- Promotions: Employees with fewer promotions or long promotion gaps are more likely to leave.

- Work-Life Balance: Roles with demanding workloads (like Sales Executives or Managers) show poorer work-life balance, increasing attrition risk.

- Tenure: Employees with shorter tenure or fewer total working years are more prone to leave.


## Final Conclusion

- Employee attrition at TechSolutions is influenced by compensation levels, promotion delays, work-life balance, and departmental stress factors.
To reduce attrition, HR should:

- Focus retention strategies on high-risk departments.

- Ensure fair and competitive pay, especially in technical roles.

- Create clear promotion pathways and career development programs.

- Improve work-life balance initiatives (flexible hours, wellness programs, reduced overtime).

- By acting on these insights, TechSolutions can lower attrition, improve employee satisfaction, and strengthen organizational stability.
